# The Lincoln Lawyer Intro Animation - CSS Project
This project is a (mostly) CSS recreation of the opening animation for The Lincoln Lawyer. 
The animation presents a dynamic title overlay against a moving map of Los Angeles, creating a cinematic feel with text cutout and blend effects. 

## Features
- Animated Map Background: A high-zoom map of Los Angeles animates from one corner to another, creating an immersive backdrop.
- Cutout Title Text Overlay: The text "The Lincoln Lawyer" appears as a cutout in a black overlay, revealing the map through the text.
- Smooth Fade-In and Zoom-In Effects: The title overlay fades in and zooms in smoothly, ending in a static frame of the title cutout over the background.


## Demo
Open index.html in a web browser to see the animation in action.
